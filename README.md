# Free-Information-Principle
A new theory of information that challenges conventional models. This paper introduces the Free Information Principle, asserting that a system's true content lies in implicit, unrepresented data. It defines Dark Information and Negative Space as foundational to meaning, where coherence is achieved by systematically eliminating irrelevance.
